# Project 4: Around The U.S.
## By Samantha Horsch via Practicum

### Project Description

This "Around The U.S." project presents the culmination of skills I have gained during the first three sprints of the Practicum program as well as the recent sprint (sprint 4), which introduced us to JavaScript.

The project is a social media website in which presents six different locations around the United States. We had the freedom to decide on different locations and images. In turn, I replaced the default selection of places with locations I've been to.
